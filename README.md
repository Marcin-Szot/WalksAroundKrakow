WalksAroundKrakow
=================

Photoblog, where I store photos I have taken in Krakow.

It is a web application made using Ruby on Rails. There are two main purposes of existence this project. First, I am learning RoR so this is a "training project" for me. Second, it is a good way to store photos I have made during my walks.
